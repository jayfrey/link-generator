<p>Scenario: Improve url generation performance when under heavy load</p>

<p>Description: We&#39;re in talks with a well-known Social Networking Service, and they would like to sue our link generation api platform as a white-labeled solution (think of twitter&#39;s t.co shortening service).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been fine with the current load, but we found that performance degrades significantly when dealing with the amount of traffic we&#39;re expecting once the SNS starts sending us traffic.</p>

<p>To properly quantify this, we&#39;ve made a benchmark to measure the amount of time url generation requests would take.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t prepared the db with the urls, you should do so now (it only takes about 5 minutes):</p>

```</p>

<p>Then, prepare the urls for siege:</p>

<p><code>
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS_ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:url_generation:prepare
RAILS_ENV=benchmark environment is not defined in config/webpacker.yml, falling back to production environment
generating siege urls
done generating urls in /tmp/url_generation.txt
</code></p>

<p>From this point on, you will just need to run the benchmark without having to seed the db nor prepare the siege urls:</p>

<p>```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS<em>ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:url</em>generation:run
